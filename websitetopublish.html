<h2>
Our Mission
</h2>

<p> Our PBIS mission is to design, implement, and monitor Tier 1 supports and interventions that increase our students’ academic, social-emotional, and behavioral growth and adjust our practices accordingly based on data driven decision making processes and feedback. Teachers will use culturally responsive, inclusive practices that eliminate barriers to student success and maintain communication with parents, families and stakeholders.
