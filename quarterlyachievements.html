<h2>
Quarterly Achievements
</h2>


<p>Every quarter students will be recognized for showing their school "PRIDE". Each department (ELA, Math, History, Science, PE and Electives) will choose two students who have embodied each PRIDE element. The first element is P = Personal Responsibility, then R = Respect. Next, I = Integrity, then D = Digital Citizenship and lastly, the E = "Excellence in all that you do".  </p>

<p>Each element helps with school safety, social responsibility and improved behavior on campus. </p>

<p>Each student that gets nominated will receive a special certificate and acknowledgment at a special assembly to celebrate their achievements with family, friends and community. </p>

<p>Check this website often as we will update with pictures of the students and their certificates. </p>
