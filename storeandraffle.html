<h2>
PBIS Store and Raffle
</h2>


<p>Students will earn "PRIDE" tickets every time they embody that element on campus. Students can earn tickets in the classroom, walking through the hallway, in the cafeteria, on the blacktop and in the quad, anywhere a staff member or adult can see students showing their school "PRIDE".  </p>

<p>Students can put their tickets in the raffle box. Then once a week, raffle tickets will be pulled for specific prizes. </p>

<p>Or students may choose to save their tickets to use in the PBIS store and "purchase" larger items with multiple tickets. </p>

<p>Students can use their tickets to get: gift cards, fidget toys, lunch time DJ, pizza for lunch with friends, special pencils and much more. </p>
